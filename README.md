# Reservoir_simulation_by_Explicit
Explicit reservoir simulation is an oil and gas engineering technique used to analyze and model the behavior and performance of oil and natural gas fields. This technology relies on simulating the physical and chemical processes that occur within the aquifer (the rocks containing the reservoir) in detail and under different conditions
